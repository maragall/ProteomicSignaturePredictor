    "*First iteration of optimization process:* \n",
    "It seems there was a misunderstanding in the search. The book \"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\" by Robert C. Martin is not directly found in the documents you have provided. However, your interest in optimizing your computational pipeline and concerns about code performance, modularity, and vectorization are well-founded. Implementing principles from \"Clean Code\" can indeed help improve the structure and efficiency of your software.\n",
    "To address the specific issues you mentioned:\n",
    "* **Slow Performance and Lack of Clear Data Structure:** This can be improved by refactoring the code to ensure that each function or module has a single responsibility. Using efficient data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for the task can also enhance performance.\n",
    "* **Non-Vectorized Operations:** Vectorization, especially in languages like Python, can significantly speed up computations. Libraries such as NumPy and Pandas are designed for efficient operation on array-based data structures, reducing the need for explicit loops.\n",
    "* **Lack of Modularity:** Breaking down the program into smaller, well-defined modules or functions not only makes the code cleaner and more understandable but also facilitates reuse and testing. Each module should have a clear purpose and interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "⠀To begin optimizing your pipeline:\n",
    "* **Profile Your Code:** Identify the bottlenecks in your current implementation. Tools like Python's cProfile or line_profiler can help you understand where most of the computation time is spent.\n",
    "* **Refactor for Clarity and Efficiency:** Apply \"Clean Code\" principles by writing functions and modules that do one thing well, have meaningful names, and minimize dependencies on other parts of the code. This makes the code easier to read, maintain, and optimize.\n",
    "* **Implement Vectorization:** Wherever possible, replace loops with vectorized operations using NumPy, Pandas, or similar libraries. This can lead to substantial performance gains, especially for numerical computations.\n",
    "* **Modularize the Code:** Organize the code into modules with clear responsibilities. This not only improves readability but also makes it easier to optimize individual components without affecting the rest of the system.\n",
    "* **Optimize Data Structures:** Use appropriate data structures for your needs. Sometimes, a simple change in data representation can lead to significant performance improvements.\n",
    "* **Parallel Processing:** For computationally intensive tasks, consider using parallel processing techniques to leverage multiple CPU cores or GPUs. Libraries like multiprocessing in Python can be used to parallelize operations easily.\n",
